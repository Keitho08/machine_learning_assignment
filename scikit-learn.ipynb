    "\n",
    "- Python https://www.python.org/downloads/\n",
    "- Numpy http://www.numpy.org/ - The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook https://jupyter.org/ - Project Jupyter exists to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages.\n",
    "- matplotlib.pyplot https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html - matplotlib.pyplot is a state-based interface to matplotlib. It provides a MATLAB-like way of plotting. pyplot is mainly intended for interactive plots and simple cases of programmatic plot generation.\n",
    "- seaborn https://seaborn.pydata.org/ - Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.\n",
    "- pandas https://pandas.pydata.org/ - pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.\n",
    "- Scikit Learn - The most widely used pyhton machine learning package available at: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html. "

    "Scikit-learn was first developed as part of a Google summer code project in 2007. It is now the most widely used Python library for machine learning. \n",

    "Machine learning is an element of computer science that focuses on the design of algorithims that can learn. The typical tasks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Concept Learning\n",
    "* Predictive Modelling\n",
    "* Clustering and finding predictive patterns in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tasks are trained based on existing data or instructions. The ultimate goal is to creat an automatic learning process that requires no human interference. \n",

    "In laymans terms, the learning considers a number of samples of data and then tries to predict properties of unknown data against the known samples. The learning problems fall into the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* supervised learning: this is data that comes with additional properties we want to predict this can be either classification or regression types.\n",
    "    - Classification: This consists of samples belonging to two or more classes and we want to predict the class of un-labelled data (e.g. Iris Flower Data Set). \n",
    "    - Regression: If the desired output includes one or more continous variable then this is referred to as regression. A real world example here may be predicting the lenght of a salmon fish based on its age and weight. \n",

    "**Training set and testing set**\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning generally consists of learning properties of a data set (training set) and testing against properties of another data set (testing set). It is common practice to split a data set to do this and use one set for training and other for testing against the training set. \n",
